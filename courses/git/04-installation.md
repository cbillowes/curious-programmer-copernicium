## Installation

Click on the download link for your operating system on the [download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) page
and follow the wizard to let the magic unfold.

Once it is done, verify that it is installed by going to your terminal and typing the following and being
prompted with the version that has been installed.

```bash
git --version
```

:white_check_mark: The default Bash terminal will be sufficient if you are using a Mac or Linux machine.\
:white_check_mark: Use the built-in Powershell terminal or the Git Bash terminal on Windows. [See more](https://zarkom.net/blogs/how-to-install-git-and-git-bash-on-windows-9140).

> ## But why the terminal? :worried:

> We are going to use the terminal to get a feel of the basics and then switch over to a GUI.
> It's better to know what happens under the covers than to blindly fall into the safety net of a GUI.
> It's even better if you stick to the terminal as it can be faster but sometimes a little tedious.
