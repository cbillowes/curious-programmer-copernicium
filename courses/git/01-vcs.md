## How things used to work

Once upon a time we used to make backups of our code.
Then we made backups of those backups.
And then those backups had backups.
It got hairy!

Deployments and website publishing was even more of a nightmare.
We would do an old-school FTP of our files to a server somewhere
and hope nothing goes wrong.

Some problems would surface:

- We didn't know what the most recent **working version** of the file is in the sea of backups.
- We didn't know what changed in the file before it stopped working.
- We didn't know which file to target when a breaking change was introduced.
- We didn't know what version of the website was live.
- We couldn't easily recover from lost files.
- Teams couldn't effectively and safely collaborate.

## A different approach

### Version Control System

Enter the Version Control System - or VCS. It is a system that will track and manage
files in your file system over time. You can see how tracked files evolve as you gain access to different
versions of it. This empowers you as an individual and teams to collaborate effectively and safely together.
You can develop and release work in an automated and efficient way.

### Why is it useful?

- Enforces discipline
- Archive versions
- Maintain historical information
- Enable collaboration
- Recover from accidental deletions or edits
- Conserve disk space

### Different systems

Some popular systems include:

- Git
- CVS
- SVN
- Mecurial
- Bazaar
- Monotone
