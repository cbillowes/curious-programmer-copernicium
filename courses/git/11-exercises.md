These exercises are intended for people who are new to software development.
I have specifically stayed away from writing code so that fewer concepts have to be covered.

These exercises are meant to be followed in chronological order.

## 1. Install

You will need to get started by [installing][install] Git on your machine.
Once it is installed, you will have access to the `git` application through the `git` command in your terminal.
Make sure you do the following:

:white_check_mark: If you are using Windows, make sure you have WSL installed.\
:white_check_mark: Download Git.\
:white_check_mark: Install Git.\
:white_check_mark: Check what version of Git is running in your terminal.

## 2. New repository

We are going to collaborate on a few simple text files as a team.
Before we get started, go to (or create) a directory that will contain all your projects that you will be working on.

> I often create a `Workspace` or `Projects` directory in my user directory.

:white_check_mark: Create a new directory for your text files.\
:white_check_mark: Initialize this directory as a git repository.\
:white_check_mark: Add a new text file with your name and put some cool details about you in it.\
:white_check_mark: Create another text file called `secrets.txt` and type `shhhhhhhh` in it. This is a secret file, ignore it from Git.

## 3. Remote repository

## What's next?

Git has the power to make you a better software developer.
But you'll have to go beyond the basic "commit, push, pull" to use it effectively!
In this course, we'll look at some of the more advanced concepts and tools to make you more productive and confident with Git.
